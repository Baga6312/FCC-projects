              <li><span class="bold">1989 - He moved to Canada at age 17 to attend Queen's University. He went to Queen's University to avoid serving in the South African military. He gained citizenship there in 1989, the same year he moved there. He then decided to leave Canada and go to America.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">1929 - He came to America to study at the University of Pennsylvania. He received an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. He then went to Stanford to get a Ph.D. in energy physics. He then dropped out two days after joining to start his first business. He became a citizen in 2002</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">1995 - He started Zip2 Corporation with his brother, Kimbal. Zip2 was an online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">1999 - With the profits from Zip2 Corporation, Elon and Kimbal started X.com. X.com was an online financial services/payments company. X.com later became what is now Paypal. In October Elon made a billion dollars when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2000 - Elon married Justine Wilson in 2000, and the couple had six children together. In 2002, their first son died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome. Musk and Wilson had five additional sons together: twins Griffin and Xavier (born in 2004), and triplets, Kai, Saxon and Damian (born in 2006).</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2002 - Elon founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of commercial space travel. In 2008, NASA granted permission for SpaceX to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station. In 2012 SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2003 - Tesla was formed in 2003. Tesla is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. In 2008, Tesla unveiled the Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges. In 2017, Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become the most valuable U.S. carmaker.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2006 - Founded by his cousins in 2006, SolarCity received Musk’s patronage from the offset; he was their primary financial backer. A solar energy company that became the leading residential solar installer in the U.S. by the mid-2010s, SolarCity installed solar energy systems that were leased to residential users. Musk, via Tesla, acquired SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6 billion in stock and incorporated it into its operations as Tesla Energy.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2015 - Musk co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit in 2015, with a for-profit artificial intelligence research lab component; it was started with a $1 billion collective pledge from its founders. Musk has been open about his interest in developing “friendly” AI that supports humanity, but he ended up resigning from the board in 2018 due to conflicts with Tesla’s AI projects</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2016 - Another research endeavor, Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of working on “brain-machine interfaces,” or BMIs, that can be implanted directly into the body. Neuroscientists have been skeptical of Neuralink’s research and claims. While they currently conduct experiments on animals, they moved plans to begin working on human subjects to 2022.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2018 - In January of 2018, The Boring Company (another business ran by Elon Musk) created a flamethrower. Elon reported that he sold 10,000 in just one day of them being released. He sold them for $500 apiece.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2018 - Musk is currently dating musician Grimes. That month, Grimes announced that she had changed her name to “c,” the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly on the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company has been described as a “predator zone” among accusations of sexual harassment.</span></li>
              <li><span class="bold">2022 - After buying up enough stock to make him a majority shareholder by April 1, Musk made the move to purchase Twitter for $44 billion at the end of April. His plans include making Twitter “better than ever” by “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”</span></li>
